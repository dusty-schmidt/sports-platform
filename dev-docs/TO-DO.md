## To Do items
- fix documentation strategy - one README.md at root,  all other docs go in docs/ or dev-docs/.  keep docs/ streamlined and not overly detailed so as to not require rewriting it everytime i make a minor change to code somewhere.

- 'global' utils/ to store logger.py and any other helper functions/scripts (main src/ files should be streamlined)

- remove all hardcoded variables from all scripts, use central configuration file
